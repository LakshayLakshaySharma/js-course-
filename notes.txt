ECMAScript
ECMAScript is a standard of javascript, 
In the late 90s when the programmers were adding new changes to the javascript, then to douge the confusion ECMAScript was introduced as a standard for the javascript. So that all the programmers work on the same page/language, all the changes that occur in the ECMAScript work for all the programmers/servers. 
You can use javascript and ECMAScript interchangeably in every situation.
